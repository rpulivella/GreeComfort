Standards Check

Lint this repository's WRITING, the prose that humans and agents both read. One
deterministic pass over every file in scope; reports FAILURES (hard blocks) and
WARNINGS (review items).

**This is not a code linter and must never become one.** Naming, imports, type
hints and error handling are not its business. The line is whether a rule is
about WORDS. A docstring saying "colour" is this gate's business; whether the
function above it is named well is not.

What that leaves in scope, and why it includes Python:

  - Markdown: README, CONTRIBUTING, CLAUDE.md, docs and the skills.
  - Python DOCSTRINGS, COMMENTS AND CONSOLE OUTPUT, because a developer reading
    source is an audience, and so is anyone reading what a script prints.
    Everything else in a .py file is blanked before a prose rule runs.

Adapted from the same author's standards-check.py in pybers, which remains
upstream for the prose rules. When a check improves there, diff the two files
and re-import rather than letting them drift.

The design constraints inherited from upstream, each earned by a bug:

  - No path-less ripgrep, and no shelling out to search at all. Files are walked
    in Python, so there is no stdin to hang on and no `grep`-aliased-to-`ugrep`
    surprise.
  - Blank, never delete. Every strip replaces a span with spaces and keeps the
    newlines, so reported line numbers stay true to the source.
  - Every banned phrase matches across a line wrap, because prose is wrapped and
    a phrase split by a newline is the same phrase.

Scopes (argparse):
  (no args)         git-changed files, tracked and untracked. The preflight.
  --all             the full tree, plus the Markdown at the repository root.
  PATH [PATH ...]   exactly those files or directories.  standards-ok: synopsis
                    Naming a path BYPASSES
                    the auto-exclusions. Directories are walked.
  --text 'STRING'   lint a raw string, no file. Treated as .md unless --ext
                    says otherwise.

It depends on nothing outside the standard library. `rich` is used when it is
installed and a plain-text fallback is used when it is not.

UPDATES
2026-09-22  Imported from pybers for GreeComfort: its scope, no hard dependency
            on rich, and the generated-code exclusions dropped with the protobuf
            they described.
